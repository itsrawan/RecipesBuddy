# Development Best Practice

## Keep it simple and clear
- Implement code in the fewest lines possible
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- choose straightforward approaches over clever ones
- extract repeted business logic to private Methods
- extract repeted UI markup to reusable components
- create utility functions for common operations

## Optimize and Readability
- prioritize code clarity over micro-optimization
- write self-documenting code with clear variable Names
- add comments for "why" not "what"


## File Structure
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility 
- Group related functionality togather
- Use consistent naming conventions
